This is the ChatGPT app which I have developed on Next.js and React using OpenAI and Web 3.0 technologies.

To run the project, type:

1.
```
git clone https://github.com/antonVosc/ChatGPT-v1.git
```

2.
```
cd ChatGPT-v1/
```

3.
```
npm install
```

4.
```
cd server/
```

5.
```
npm i
```

6.
```
cd ../
```

7.
```
npm run dev
```
